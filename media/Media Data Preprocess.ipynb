       "'b rorschach test  michael e  miller 1453 words 5 november 2015 the washington post wp final a03 english copyright 2015  the washington post co  all rights reserved university of north texas professor dorothy bland was walking around corinth  her affluent dallas suburb  on oct  24 when she was stopped by police  bland  who is african american  had been exercising in the street  the officers  who are both white  asked her to walk on the opposite side so she could see oncoming traffic or  even better  to use the sidewalk  roughly three minutes later  she was on her way  the short and seemingly simple interaction has proved anything but  however  several days later  bland  who is the dean of unt s mayborn school of journalism  wrote an op ed in the dallas morning news claiming that she had been racially profiled   walking while black is crime in many jurisdictions   she wrote   may god have mercy on our nation   corinth police responded by releasing the officers  dashboard camera video of the interaction and asserting that bland had turned  cordial  stop into  racial issue    if we didn t have the video  these officers would have serious allegations against them   corinth police chief debra walthall told fox news   every white officer that stops an african american does not constitute racial profiling   now it is bland  not the officers  who is facing pressure  as more than 3 500 people have signed petition urging the university to fire her  although disciplinary action against either the professor or the officers appears unlikely  the video is still generating heated debate about law enforcement and race relations  like bland  many americans see the stop as subtle but significant instance of racial prejudice by police   if officers were concerned only about bland s safety and her impeding traffic  why did they ask her for her id  why did they need her birth date  why did they radio in  name check    wrote dallas morning news writer leona allen  who is african american   we re not fools   allen added   sure looks like they re calling to check to see if she had outstanding warrants   many others were equally angry   but with bland   as person of color  this upsets me   said former dallas mayor ron kirk  who is also african american   she took advantage of very innocent and thoughtful police response   walk on the  correct  side of the street   she s just looking for her skip gates moment   kirk told the morning news  referring to the 2009 arrest of black harvard professor henry louis  skip  gates  which led to accusations of racism against the cambridge  mass   police officer involved   there s real danger here   on youtube  meanwhile  copy of the video quickly gathered hundreds of comments  many of them containing expletives and racial epithets   it s rorschach test   morning news columnist jacquielynn floyd wrote of the video   the way we interpret it probably says great deal about our beliefs  expectations and experiences in nation that remains woefully divided along racial lines   were it not for the country s simmering debate over race and policing  the encounter could be chalked up as an example of the  rashomon  effect  the phenomenon  in which different people have contradictory interpretations of the same event  draws its name from the eponymous 1950 classic film by japanese director akira kurosawa  what is undisputed is that dorothy bland was walking in the street near her corinth home when she was stopped by two white police officers  bland wrote in her recounting   like most african americans  am familiar with the phrase  driving while black   but was really being stopped for walking on the street in my own neighborhood   she continued   knowing that the police officers are typically armed with guns and are lot bigger than my 5 feet  4 inches  had no interest in my life s story playing out like trayvon martin s death  stopped and asked the two officers if there was problem  don t remember getting decent answer before one of the officers asked me where lived and for identification   i remember saying something like   around the corner  this is my neighborhood  and i m taxpayer who pays lot of taxes   as for the i d  question  how many americans typically carry i d  with them on their morning walk   i guess was simply brown face in an affluent neighborhood  told the police didn t like to walk in the rain  and one of them told me   my dog doesn t like to walk in the rain   ouch   bland was clearly angered by the encounter  she compared the stop to other encounters that have led to the deaths of african americans at the hands of police officers   although am not related to sandra bland   who died in texas jail after being arrested during traffic stop   i thought about her  freddie gray and the dozens of others who have died while in police custody   the professor wrote   for safety s sake  posted the photo of the officers on facebook  and within hours  more than 100 facebook friends spread the news from new york to california   she also wrote that she refused  to let this incident ruin my life   bland s account is largely accurate  when it is compared with the video  the only details she appears to get wrong are her claim that the officers  interrupted  her walk with  flashing lights and sirens  and that after asking  the two officers is there was problem       don t remember getting decent answer before o '"
